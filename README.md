## Overview
The project is divided into six problems:
1. **Fundamentals**: Data types, control flow, and custom functions.
2. **Probability**: Probability distributions, densities, and simulation.
3. **Simulation**: Strategies for multiple-choice test simulations.
4. **Data Wrangling**: Cleaning and transforming datasets.
5. **Text Wrangling**: Standardizing ZIP codes and phone numbers.
6. **Data Analysis**: ANOVA and regression modeling using the `palmerpenguins` dataset.

## Packages
Install the following R packages before running the project:

```r
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("palmerpenguins")
